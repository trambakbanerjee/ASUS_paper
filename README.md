What is ASUS?
======

ASUS (Adaptive SURE-thresholding Using Side information) is a general framework for estimating a high dimensional sparse parameter in the presence of auxiliary data that encode side information on sparsity.  It is a robust data
combination procedure in the sense that even when pooling non-informative auxiliary data ASUS would be at least as efficient as competing soft thresholding based methods that do not use auxiliary data. Moreover, we develop new theories to characterize regimes in which ASUS far outperforms competitive shrinkage estimators, and establish precise conditions under which ASUS is
asymptotically optimal.
