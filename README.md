What is ASUS?
======

ASUS (Adaptive SURE-thresholding Using Side information) is a general framework for estimating a high dimensional sparse parameter in the presence of auxiliary data that encode side information on sparsity.  It is a robust data
combination procedure in the sense that even when pooling non-informative auxiliary data ASUS would be at least as efficient as competing soft thresholding based methods that do not use auxiliary data.
